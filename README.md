# File naming

|                               | Convention                  | Example                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| File & folder names           | kebab-case                  | `nav-bar-mobile.tsx`, `nav-bar/`           |
| React component (inside file) | PascalCase                  | `export function ExpensesList()`           |
| Custom hooks                  | camelCase with `use` prefix | `useExpenses`, `useFriends`                |
| Variables & functions         | camelCase                   | `expenses`, `getUserById()`                |
| Constants & enums             | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE            | `API_BASE`, `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`              |
| Next.js special files         | lowercase exact names       | `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `route.ts`, etc. |

## Note

`custom/calendar.tsx` in an imported third party component: https://date-picker.luca-felix.com/

If modifications to ShadCN components are needed, copy the component to `components/shared/` and rename it (e.g. `custom-button.tsx`).
This allows you to safely compare diffs when ShadCN updates are released and avoid breaking the app by modifying base components directly.
