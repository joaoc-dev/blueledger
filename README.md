## Note

`third-party/calendar.tsx` in an imported third party component: https://date-picker.luca-felix.com/

If modifications to third party components are needed, copy the component to `components/third-party-modified/`.
If modifications to ShadCN components are needed, copy the component to `components/ui-modified/`.

This allows you to safely compare diffs when updates are released and avoid breaking the app by modifying base components directly.
