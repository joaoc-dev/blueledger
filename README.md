## 🚀 Getting Started (Development)

We use **Docker** to run a local MongoDB replica set in development to enable support for [transactions](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/transactions/).

1. Start MongoDB in Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Initialize the replica set (only required the first time):

   ```bash
   docker exec blueledger-mongo-dev-rs mongosh --eval "rs.initiate({_id: 'rs0', members: [{ _id: 0, host: 'host.docker.internal:27030' }]})"
   ```

3. Start the dev server
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

**Unit vs. Storybook**

- Keep Vitest focused on pure logic (mappers, schemas, data-table utils); use Storybook for complex UI behavior.

Example:

- High‑interaction table UX.
- **Variants**: default, filtered, sorted, empty, error.
- **Data mocking**: use `msw` in Storybook to provide realistic data, errors, and artificial delays.
- **Interactions**: write `play()` tests with `@storybook/test`:
  - toolbar actions (search, filters, view options, reset, export)
  - pagination and sorting (headers, next/prev, page size)
  - column drag/reorder/resize and pin/unpin

## Note

`third-party/calendar.tsx` in an imported third party component: https://date-picker.luca-felix.com/

If modifications to third party components are needed, copy the component to `components/third-party-modified/`.

If modifications to ShadCN components are needed, copy the component to `components/ui-modified/`.

This allows you to safely compare diffs when updates are released and avoid breaking the app by modifying base components directly.
